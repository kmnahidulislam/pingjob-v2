# Facebook Token Expiration Solution

## Current Problem
Facebook access tokens are expiring within minutes, causing job posting failures.

## Root Cause
Facebook has strict token expiration policies:
- User tokens: 1-2 hours
- Page tokens: Can be made permanent but require specific setup

## Long-term Solutions

### Option 1: Never-Expiring Page Access Token (Recommended)
1. Get a user access token with `pages_show_list` permission
2. Exchange it for a page access token
3. Extend the page token to never expire using Graph API

### Option 2: Token Refresh System
Implement automatic token refresh in the application

### Option 3: Manual Token Management
Create a simple admin interface to update tokens when they expire

## Immediate Solution Needed
Since tokens keep expiring, we need to either:
1. Get a never-expiring page token
2. Implement token refresh logic
3. Create a simple token update interface

The current approach of manually updating tokens every hour is not sustainable for a production application.

## Facebook App Settings Check
The app may need to be switched to "Live" mode instead of "Development" mode for longer-lasting tokens.
