# Quick Package Name Location Guide

## From Your Screenshot Analysis

I can see you're in the Google Play Console dashboard for your PingJob app. The package name might not be immediately visible on the main dashboard.

## Try These 3 Quick Methods:

### Method 1: App Content Section
1. In the **left sidebar**, click **"App content"**
2. Look for **"App details"** section
3. Package name should be clearly listed there

### Method 2: Check Your Play Store URL
1. Go to Google Play Store: https://play.google.com
2. Search for your "PingJob" app
3. Click on your app
4. Look at the URL - it will show: `...?id=YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME`

### Method 3: Browser URL Analysis
From your screenshot, I can see your console URL contains: `4878611404259928917`

This app ID can help us determine the package name through the Google Play Store.

## Alternative: Use Current Configuration

If we can't find the exact package name, we can proceed with the current configuration:

**Current PingJob Setup:**
- Package: `com.pingjob` 
- Version: 5 (incremented from your version 4)
- Version Name: 2.0.0

This should work for replacing your existing app, as Google Play will match it to your existing app ID.

## What You Can Try Right Now:

1. **Click "App content"** in your left sidebar
2. **Take a screenshot** of that page
3. **Or share your app's Google Play Store URL** if you can find your app in the store

The package name is definitely there - we just need to look in the right section of the console!
