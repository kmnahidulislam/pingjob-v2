# How to Find Your Existing Google Play Store App Information

## What I Need From Your Google Play Console

To replace your existing app with PingJob, please go to your Google Play Console and find:

### 1. Package Name
**Where to find it:**
- Login to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
- Select your existing "pingjob" app
- Look at the app dashboard - you'll see "Package name" 
- It looks like: `com.yourcompany.pingjob` or `com.pingjob.app` or similar

### 2. Current Version Code
**Where to find it:**
- In your app → Go to "Release" → "Production" 
- Look at your most recent release
- You'll see "Version code" (this is a number like 1, 5, 12, etc.)

### 3. Current Store Listing Name
**Where to find it:**
- In your app → Go to "Store listing"
- Look at "App name" field
- This is what users see in the Play Store

## Example of What I Need

```
Package name: com.example.pingjob
Current version code: 7  
Current app name: PingJob Career Search
```

## What I'll Do With This Information

Once you provide these 3 details:
1. Update all PingJob configuration files to match your existing app
2. Increment the version code (e.g., 7 → 8) 
3. Build a release bundle you can upload to replace your existing app
4. Your existing app will transform into the full PingJob platform

## If You Can't Find This Information

If you're having trouble finding these details:
1. Take a screenshot of your Google Play Console app dashboard
2. Take a screenshot of your latest release in the "Production" section
3. I can help identify the information from the screenshots

**Please share your app's package name, current version code, and current store name so I can configure PingJob to replace your existing app.**
