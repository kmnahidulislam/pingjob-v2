# How to Get Your PingJob Android APK File

## Current Status
Your Android app is **ready for building** but needs compilation to create the APK file.

## Location of Android Files
```
üìÅ android/                    <- Main Android project
   üìÅ app/
      üìÅ src/main/             <- App source code
      üìÑ build.gradle          <- Build configuration
   üìÑ build.gradle             <- Project build settings
   üìÑ gradlew                  <- Gradle wrapper
```

## Option 1: Export for External Building ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

Since Replit doesn't have Android SDK, you can export your project:

### Download Project

2. **Extract on your computer**
3. **Open in Android Studio**

### Build Commands (on your computer):
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug        # Creates debug APK
./gradlew assembleRelease      # Creates release APK
```

**APK will be created at:**
`android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Option 2: Cloud Build Services

### GitHub Actions (Free)
1. Push project to GitHub
2. Add Android build workflow
3. Download APK from build artifacts

### CodeMagic (Paid)
1. Connect your repository
2. Configure Android build
3. Automatic APK generation
