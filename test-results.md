## CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 1. Input Validation Bypass
**Severity: HIGH**
- Registration accepts invalid email formats and empty passwords
- User type validation not enforced (accepts "invalid_type")
- Missing field length restrictions

### 2. Social Media Integration Errors
**Severity: MEDIUM**
- Missing database table: social_media_posts
- Facebook/Twitter/Instagram API tokens expired
- Job posting social media integration failing

### 3. Resume Processing System
**Severity: MEDIUM**
- File upload functionality needs testing
- Resume parsing accuracy requires validation
- Scoring algorithm needs verification with real data

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Fixes Required:
1. Implement proper input validation for registration
2. Create missing social_media_posts table
3. Add file upload security measures
4. Test resume parsing with actual files

### Performance Optimizations:
1. API response times are acceptable (44-520ms)
2. Database queries performing well
3. Consider caching for frequently accessed data

### Security Enhancements:
1. SQL injection protection working correctly
2. Add CSRF token validation
3. Implement file upload size limits
4. Add rate limiting for API endpoints

## OVERALL PLATFORM STATUS: 75% FUNCTIONAL
- Core functionality working correctly
- Authentication and role-based access operational
