# Repository Options for Codemagic Build

## Option 1: Create GitHub Repository (Recommended)

### Steps:
1. **Create new GitHub repository**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it "pingjob-mobile" or similar
   - Make it private if you prefer

2. **Upload your project files**
   - Download/zip this entire Replit project
   - Upload all files to your GitHub repository
   - Ensure these key files are included:
     - `package.json`
     - `capacitor.config.ts`
     - `android/` folder
     - `client/` folder
     - `server/` folder

3. **Connect to Codemagic**
   - In Codemagic dashboard, click "Add application"
   - Select "GitHub" as source
   - Authorize Codemagic to access your repository
   - Select your pingjob-mobile repository

## Option 2: ZIP Upload (Simpler)

### Steps:
1. **Download project as ZIP**
   - In Replit, you can download the entire project
   - Or manually create ZIP with all project files

2. **Upload to Codemagic**
   - In Codemagic dashboard, click "Add application"
   - Select "Upload project"
   - Upload your ZIP file
   - Codemagic will extract and build

## Option 3: GitLab/Bitbucket

Similar to GitHub but using:
- GitLab: https://gitlab.com
- Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org

## What Files to Include

Ensure your repository/ZIP contains:
```
/
├── package.json
├── capacitor.config.ts
├── vite.config.ts
├── android/
│   ├── app/build.gradle
│   └── app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
├── client/
│   ├── src/
│   └── public/
├── server/
└── shared/
```

## Recommendation

**Use Option 2 (ZIP Upload)** if you want the quickest setup:
- No need to create Git repository
- Direct upload to Codemagic
- Immediate build start

**Use Option 1 (GitHub)** if you want:
- Version control
- Ability to trigger rebuilds easily
- Collaboration features

## After Repository Connection

1. Codemagic detects Capacitor project automatically
2. Selects Android build configuration
3. Runs build with your configured package name `com.pingjob`
4. Produces `app-release.aab` for Google Play upload

The build process is the same regardless of which option you choose.
