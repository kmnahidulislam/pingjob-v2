# Replace Existing Google Play Store App with PingJob

## Overview
You have an existing app on Google Play Store that needs to be replaced with the new PingJob professional networking platform. This guide covers updating your existing app listing.

## Important Requirements

### App Package Name
**CRITICAL**: The new PingJob app must use the **same package name** as your existing app to replace it properly.

Current PingJob package: `com.pingjob.app`
Your existing app package: `[NEED TO UPDATE]`

### Update Package Name
We need to update the PingJob app to match your existing app's package name:

1. **Find your existing package name** in Google Play Console
2. **Update these files**:
   - `capacitor.config.ts` - appId field
   - `android/app/build.gradle` - applicationId
   - `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - package attribute
   - `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` - package_name string

## Steps to Replace Existing App

### Step 1: Get Existing App Details
From your Google Play Console, collect:
- **Package Name** (e.g., com.yourcompany.existingapp)
- **App Name** (current name in store)
- **Signing Certificate** (download from Play Console if needed)
- **Version Code** (increment by 1 for new version)

### Step 2: Update PingJob Configuration
```bash
# Update package name in capacitor.config.ts
appId: "YOUR_EXISTING_PACKAGE_NAME"

# Update build.gradle
applicationId "YOUR_EXISTING_PACKAGE_NAME"

# Rebuild with new package name
npm run build && npx cap sync android
```

### Step 3: Version Management
```gradle
// In android/app/build.gradle
defaultConfig {
    versionCode EXISTING_VERSION_CODE + 1
    versionName "2.0.0" // New major version for complete replacement
}
```

### Step 4: App Signing
**Option A: Use Existing Keystore**
- Use the same keystore that signed your existing app
- This maintains update continuity

**Option B: Upload New Keystore**
- If you don't have the original keystore
- Use Play App Signing to let Google manage signing

### Step 5: Store Listing Update
Update your existing app's store listing with PingJob content:

```
App Name: PingJob - Job Search & Professional Network
Short Description: Professional job search and career networking platform
Full Description: [Use complete description from google-play-store-setup.md]
```

### Step 6: Upload New Version
1. **Build signed release bundle**:
   ```bash
   cd android && ./gradlew bundleRelease
   ```

2. **Upload to existing app** in Google Play Console
   - Go to your existing app
   - Navigate to "Release" â†’ "Production" 
   - Upload new `app-release.aab` file
   - Update release notes explaining the major update

3. **Update store assets**:
   - New app icon (use store-assets-generator.html)
   - New screenshots showing PingJob features
   - New feature graphic highlighting job search capabilities

## Migration Strategy

What users will see:
