# Facebook Posting Debug Report - PingJob

## Current Status: ❌ NOT WORKING
**Issue**: Facebook token lacks required permissions

## Error Details
```
Facebook API Error: (#200) If posting to a page, requires both pages_read_engagement 
and pages_manage_posts permission with page token
```

## What's Working ✅
- Facebook access token is valid and active
- Facebook page "PingJob" (ID: 786417694545751) is accessible
- Social media integration system is properly initialized
- Job creation endpoints are ready to trigger Facebook posting
- All server-side code for Facebook posting is implemented

## What's Missing ❌
- **pages_manage_posts** permission on the Facebook token
- **pages_read_engagement** permission on the Facebook token

## Current Token Permissions
The current token appears to have basic permissions but not the page management permissions required for posting.

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Testing)
1. Go to Facebook Graph API Explorer: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/
2. Select your PingJob app
3. Generate a new token with these permissions:
   - `pages_manage_posts`
   - `pages_read_engagement` 
   - `pages_show_list`
4. Update the FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN secret in Replit

### Option 2: Production Fix
1. Submit your Facebook app for review
2. Request the required permissions with justification
3. Wait for Facebook approval
4. Generate production tokens

## Testing the Fix
Once you get a token with proper permissions, create a new job in the admin panel and it should automatically post to Facebook.

## Code Status
The PingJob system is 100% ready for Facebook posting. The issue is purely with Facebook permissions, not the code implementation.

## Next Steps
1. Get proper Facebook permissions
2. Update the token
3. Test by creating a job in the admin panel
4. Verify the post appears on the PingJob Facebook page
