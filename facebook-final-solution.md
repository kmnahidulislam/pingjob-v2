# Facebook Posting Final Solution

## Current Issue Analysis
Multiple tokens have been provided but all fail with the same error:
"requires both pages_read_engagement and pages_manage_posts permission with page token"

## Root Cause
The tokens provided are either:
1. User tokens (not page tokens)
2. Page tokens without admin permissions
3. App in development mode limiting permissions

## Immediate Solution Options

### Option 1: Verify Page Admin Status
- Confirm you are listed as "Admin" (not Editor/Moderator) on the Facebook page
- Go to Facebook page → Settings → Page roles
- Only admins can generate posting tokens

### Option 2: App Review Submission
- Submit Facebook app for review with pages_manage_posts permission
- Provide business justification for job posting automation
- Timeline: 2-7 business days

### Option 3: Temporary Workaround
- Implement manual posting interface in admin panel
- Admin can copy job details and manually post to Facebook
- Maintains workflow until Facebook approval obtained

### Option 4: Switch to Alternative Platforms
- Focus on Twitter/LinkedIn integration (simpler approval process)
- Implement Facebook posting later after permissions resolved

## Recommended Path Forward
1. Submit app for Facebook review (long-term solution)
2. Implement manual posting interface (immediate workaround)
3. Add Twitter integration (easier setup)

## Technical Implementation
If we get proper permissions, the current code will work immediately.
The social media integration is built and ready.
